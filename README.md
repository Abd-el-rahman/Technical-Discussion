**# About This Project**
This project is used to track all tickets, issues, and requests related to the Seven application and website. The goal is to log all problems and enhancements in a central location to monitor progress on fixes and feature improvements for Seven Consumer Finance.
This project is for the development and maintenance of the Seven ticketing system. 

**## Purpose**
The purpose of the Seven ticketing system is to provide a platform for internal users to raise tickets for any issues they face or features they would like to request.

**## Key Features**
* Ability for internal users to submit tickets via the portal
* Categorization of tickets by type, priority, status, etc.
* Automatic routing and assignment of tickets to relevant team or staff members
* SLA tracking with escalation workflows
* Reporting and analytics around ticket volumes, resolution times, trends, etc.

**## Team**
